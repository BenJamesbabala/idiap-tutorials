Torch tutorials for Deep Learning, Tools and Methods workshop (July 4-5-6, Idiap)
============

Worksop website: http://www.idiap.ch/workshop/dltm/

1. MNIST-autograd example shows usage of autograd to train neural networks and visualize t-SNE embeddings of learned features
2. pretrained-resnet shows how to load pretrain ResNet networks, visualize it and propagate a single image to predict it's classes
3. wide-resnet-multiGPU shows how to train state-of-the-art networks on CIFAR using multiple GPUs on a single machine.
